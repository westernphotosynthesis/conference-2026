        <p>The Western Photosynthesis Conference (WPC) is pleased to announce its 35th annual meeting, bringing together
        researchers from diverse disciplines to advance our understanding of photosynthetic processes. As one of three regional
        photosynthesis conferences in the United States, the WPC provides a unique platform for scientists to share knowledge,
        collaborate, and foster professional growth, particularly for early-career scholars.</p>

        <p>This year's conference, themed <strong>"Harnessing the Power of Photosynthesis: From Fundamentals to Applications,"</strong> will explore cutting-edge research in areas such as mechanisms of light stress adaptation, structural dynamics and functional
        implications, advances in cellular and molecular mechanisms, and innovations in photosynthetic technology and
        applications. Additionally, topics will include integrative approaches at the ecosystem and global levels, insights into
        evolution and diversity, carbon metabolism and photorespiration, and photosynthetic electron transport pathways. The
        conference will be held at the Green Mountain Retreat, located in Los Gatos, CA, just a 25-minute drive from the San
        Jose Airport, providing a convenient and scenic setting for attendees to engage in meaningful scientific discussions and
        networking opportunities. By bringing together researchers from across the Western United States and beyond, the WPC
        aims to drive innovation, advance fundamental knowledge, and inspire the next generation of scientists in the field of
        photosynthesis.</p>
